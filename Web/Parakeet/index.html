    <!--Inserting text displaying basic information about parakeets along with basic coloring and designing of the layout of text-->
    <p>The normal primary color for parakeets is <strong class="green">green</strong>. This lets them hide better among tree leaves when they are pursued by predators.</p>
    <p>The <strong class="blue">blue</strong> color is a recent mutation, caused by the absence of <strong class="yellow">yellow</strong>  coloration from the original <strong class="green">green</strong> . Although a popular color for pet birds , a <strong class="blue">blue</strong>  parakeet would probably not survive long in the wild.</p>
